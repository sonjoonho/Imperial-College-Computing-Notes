## Cybersecurity Asymmetry

### Attacking is easy

- Criminal organisations and nation states have any resources.
- Can ignore ethical concerns.
- *Only need to find **one** way in.*

### Defending is hard

- Defenses interfere with business goals.
- Hard to enforce law across national barriers.
- Hard to identity who launched an attack and from where.
- Impossible to find all the bugs in code.
- *Defenders must protect on **all*** fronts.*

## Human factors

- Social engineering attacks.
- Weak passwords.
- Insider threats.
- Coercion.
